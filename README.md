## Emoji Input

[](https://puu.sh/EKoql/311488796a.png)

For the Emoji Input I decided to pursue a simplistic multi-button option, similiar to a 0-5 star rating system. Design wise, buttons are flexible with straightforward usability and scalable if more emoji expression is desired.

The tradeoffs of this approach would be a streamlined review process flow in exchange for reduced expression. I thought the sacrifice in the context of the page would be tolerable because whether these reviews were for internal or external presentation, by reducing the emoji options to a minimum, this approach allows the message of the review to be conveyed succinctly while also mitigating decision fatigue during the review process.
